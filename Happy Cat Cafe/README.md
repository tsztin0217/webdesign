# Happy Cat Cafe Business Website
In this project, I've learned to use classes, divs, and CSS positioning to create a responsive business web page for my imaginary client: Happy Cat Cafe.<br>
Please feel free to visit the [original website](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/tsztin0217/build-your-own-business-website) hosted by Dash on General Assembly or view the demo from this repository!<br>
Images from the website were created using AI generated art (https://pixai.art/).
